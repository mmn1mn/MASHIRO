# SkyStore (minimal)

This folder contains a minimal Vite scaffold to run `App.jsx` provided in the workspace root.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
```

Notes:
- Tailwind utilities are loaded via CDN in `index.html` so no Tailwind build step is required.
- If you prefer, move `App.jsx` into `src/` and update imports accordingly.
- Dependencies are listed in `package.json` (React, React DOM, lucide-react, Vite).
